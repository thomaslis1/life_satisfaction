### Predicting Life Satisfaction with Linear Regression 
# A linear regression model was used to predict the life satisfaction score of different countries based on their GDP

# For a given GDP, life satisfaction can then be predicted:

E.g. Make a prediction for Cyprus:
x_new = [[37_655.2]] #Cyprus' GDP per capita in 2020
print(model.predict(x_new))
