# Predicting Life Satisfaction with Linear Regression 
A linear regression model was used to predict the life satisfaction score of different countries based on their GDP. </br> </br>
For a given GDP, life satisfaction can then be predicted:

E.g. Make a prediction for Cyprus: </br>
x_new = [[37_655.2]] (Cyprus' GDP per capita in 2020) </br>
print(model.predict(x_new))
